# q3 pump–probe notebook: 26 September 2026

Measurement-PC workflow: pull `tls-spectroscopy`, run the named Python module,
then inspect NAS results before selecting another experiment. No hardware is
accessed by `--plan`. Do not run another acquisition concurrently.

NAS root: `Z:/FluxTeam/Data/FTT02_AlOxJJ_2026_08_28/RFSOC`
(Mac mount: `/Volumes/ourphoton/FluxTeam/Data/FTT02_AlOxJJ_2026_08_28/RFSOC`).

## Baseline findings

The full-band localizer found strong loss near 4.098 GHz. The subsequent
eight-delay measurement put the feature nearer 4.106 GHz, but changed both the
delay protocol and program chunking. Those measurements alone did not establish
TLS motion.

The unchunked A–B–A comparison used a shared calibration, 2-us reference holds,
40-us returns, and A=[25,60,100] versus B=[4,8,25] us survival increments.
Session `q3/q3_pump_probe_protocol_check_20260926T200743Z_138f511c`
completed at commit `3d4fc6b`. In the common 25-us observable, B was displaced
by about +2.1 MHz relative to the average A curve; IQ centroids showed the same
effect. This implicated protocol dependence without identifying a mechanism.

The follow-up session
`q3/q3_pump_probe_history_check_20260926T201656Z_1ae78613` completed all eight
arms at commit `8852cad`:
A10, B10, A500, B500, B500, A500, B10, A10. The numbers are park idle in us
after readout and feedback reset. Each arm acquired 91 frequencies from
4.080–4.125 GHz and 500 shots per condition, with one shared calibration.

Descriptive translations of B against A, using the shared normalized 25-us
population and linear interpolation over 4092–4114 MHz:

| Comparison | 10-us idle | 500-us idle |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| First adjacent A/B pair | +2.360 MHz | −0.240 MHz |
| Final adjacent A/B pair | +1.714 MHz | +0.718 MHz |
| Repeat-averaged curves | +1.862 MHz | +0.242 MHz |
| Repeat-averaged IQ projections | +1.778 MHz | +0.249 MHz |

These are shape-alignment estimates, not independently calibrated TLS
frequencies or confidence intervals. A500 also drifted about −1.28 MHz between
its two scans. Median classified P0 was 0.276–0.338 at 10-us idle and
0.116–0.140 at 500-us idle; median P1−P0 improved from 0.316–0.356 to
0.414–0.456. These reference signals include assignment/preparation effects and
must not be interpreted directly as thermal populations.

The longer pause substantially reduces the protocol mismatch. It does not
distinguish flux memory, bath dynamics, reset effects, or other causes, and does
not remove all drift. The next experiment therefore sweeps a small region and
uses nearby-in-time controls instead of assuming one fixed TLS frequency.

## First direct-microwave pilot

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run
```

Seven target frequencies: 4.094, 4.098, 4.100, 4.102, 4.104, 4.106, 4.110 GHz.
At each target, pump and probe use the same flux excursion. The microwave tone
is 15 us at gain 3000, with controls: zero-gain sham, nominal resonance from the
frozen flux model, and ±20 MHz detunings. Each condition has ground/excited
preparation and 2/10-us probe holds (an 8-us increment). The ground preparation
plays a zero-gain pi-length waveform to preserve timing.

There are three randomized repeats of 200 shots: 336 blocks, 67,200 recorded
probe shots. The four microwave controls for a given frequency/state/hold are
adjacent. Native reset runs before the pump and again after it. All conditions
retain the pinned native correction, 0.5-us arrival, 40-us complete pre-readout
return, and 500-us idle after the probe readout. Unlike the preceding scan,
the next pre-pump reset follows that idle. One calibration is shared.

Zero **additional** recovery does not mean zero pump-to-probe time: the
40-us return, readout, variable feedback reset, and probe preparation intervene.
After each reset, a 20-us reference-time guard from the final readout endpoint
includes the 10-us feedback wait and 10-us instruction headroom. This is needed
because QICK `wait_all` does not advance its pulse reference time
([QICK timing documentation](https://docs.qick.dev/latest/_autosummary/qick.asm_v1.html#qick.asm_v1.QickProgram.sync_all)).
The actual guard is recorded in per-block telemetry; total reset latency is not.
This pilot is not sensitive to every
possible short-lived TLS response and does not test persistent displacement.

Outputs are under `q3/q3_pump_probe_pilot_<UTC>_<id>/`: `manifest.json`,
`config.json`, `summary.csv`, and raw IQ `point_*.npz`. Completed blocks are
checkpointed and acquisition stops on error. Do not resume a partial session
by mixing a new calibration into it.

The first pilot session, `q3_pump_probe_pilot_20260926T203812Z_94120f74`,
stopped before block 8 after a Windows `WinError 5` during manifest replacement.
Blocks 0–7 have intact 200-shot raw IQ files and CSV rows. The subsequent error
checkpoint succeeded, indicating the denial was intermittent. Checkpoint
replacement now retries access conflicts up to eight attempts over 3.55 seconds;
it does not repeat acquisition or fall back to truncating the manifest. A
persistent denial still stops the run and retains `.pending` for recovery.
Restart this short partial pilot as a fresh session and calibration.

Evaluate excited survival together with ground-probe excitation, reference
contrast, both detuned controls, repeat consistency, and raw IQ changes. Any
effect remains a pump-dependent response until follow-up controls establish its
origin. A persistent-spectrum test needs a separate pump-once/observe protocol.

## Completed pilot and pump-frequency follow-up

Session `q3_pump_probe_pilot_20260926T204545Z_4de3530d` completed all 336
blocks at commit `6731141`, from 20:45:50 to 20:48:00 UTC. The summary has
67,200 probe shots and every manifest block reports 200 records, a 40-us complete
return, and a 20-us reset reference guard. Each condition pools three independent
acquisition blocks of 200 shots.

The strongest 10-us loss lies at model coordinates 4.104 and 4.106 GHz. There
is no convincing selective survival improvement from the nominally resonant
pump at this dose:

| Target (GHz) | Excited-prepared P10: sham | near | −20 MHz | +20 MHz |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4.100 | .4333 | .5117 | .4983 | .5183 |
| 4.104 | .3650 | .3933 | .3800 | .3567 |
| 4.106 | .2917 | .3250 | .3283 | .3467 |

At 4.104/4.106 GHz the near-minus-sham differences are +.0283 ± .0280 and
+.0333 ± .0266 (one binomial standard error). At 4.100 GHz, the apparent
improvement also occurs with detuned pumps, so it is not selective evidence.

At 4.098 GHz, ground-prepared P10 is .2483 near versus .1817 sham: +.0667
± .0236, with repeat differences +.035, +.075, +.090. The six raw IQ blocks
were reclassified using the saved payload calibration and exactly reproduce
the stored counts. This is a candidate extra-excitation signal, not a confirmed
upward-transition rate: short-reference P_g also differs, several conditions
were inspected, and drift is not included in these errors. Across frequencies,
the mean near-minus-sham ground P10 difference grows from −.0071 to +.0043 to
+.0707 over the three repeats. Reference signals also drift, so pooling shots
alone overstates precision for physical conclusions.

The follow-up keeps gain 3000 and 15-us duration and maps pump frequency:

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run --frequency-check
```

Probe targets are 4.098 (candidate extra excitation), 4.104/4.106 (strong loss),
and 4.110 GHz (flank). For every target/state/hold, a sham precedes and follows
a randomized sweep of pump detunings −20, −10, −8, −6, −4, −2, 0, +2, +4,
+6, +8, +10, +20 MHz. The two shams provide a check on drift during the sweep.
There are four repeats of 400 shots per block, 960 blocks total. Preparation,
holds, return timing, resets and idle timing remain those of the pilot.
Outputs use `q3/q3_pump_probe_frequency_check_<UTC>_<id>/`; `control_position`
identifies the bracketing references in the CSV and manifest. Check these
references and repeat consistency before interpreting any narrow response.

## Frequency-check results and locally bracketed confirmation

Session `q3_pump_probe_frequency_check_20260926T205654Z_d0b21866` completed
all 960 blocks (384,000 shots) at commit `267986e`, from 20:56:58 to 21:06:44
UTC. CSV populations/counts match the manifest; every block reports 400 records.
The pulse/reset telemetry retains the 40-us return and 20-us reset guard.

For each target/repeat/preparation/hold, interpolate the two sham populations
linearly in acquisition start time and subtract that estimate from each pump
population. This removes an assumed linear trend, not arbitrary fluctuations
or pump carryover. The 64 sweeps span a median 8.52 seconds between their sham
starts (maximum 10.83 seconds). The median absolute before/after sham change is
0.045; the maximum is 0.220. Consequently binomial shot errors alone substantially
understate uncertainty in a repeatable physical effect. All detunings within a
sweep share the same references and their errors are correlated.

Selected exploratory contrasts (classified population, not calibrated thermal
population):

| Probe target | Pump detuning | Preparation / hold | Mean pump minus interpolated sham | Individual repeats |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| 4.098 GHz | +8 MHz | g / 10 us | +0.0764 | +0.0206, +0.1167, +0.1596, +0.0086 |
| 4.098 GHz | +8 MHz | g / 2 us | +0.0445 | −0.0223, +0.0936, +0.0423, +0.0643 |
| 4.110 GHz | +8 MHz | g / 2 us | +0.0564 | +0.0489, +0.0210, +0.0092, +0.1466 |
| 4.110 GHz | +8 MHz | e / 2 us | −0.0646 | −0.0367, −0.0113, −0.0689, −0.1416 |

For the first row the binomial standard error of the mean is 0.0135, while the
standard error estimated from four repeat contrasts is 0.0368. These exploratory
comparisons were selected after examining many conditions; they are not a
confirmatory significance test. At 4.098 GHz the near-pump ground/10-us contrast
is only +0.0129, with repeat standard error 0.0418, so the earlier near-pump
candidate did not reproduce as a stable effect. There is still no clear,
repeatable selective improvement of excited survival at 4.104/4.106 GHz.

All twelve raw IQ files for the 4.098-GHz ground/10-us +8-MHz pump and its
bracketing shams were reclassified with this run's saved payload classifier;
they reproduce the CSV counts exactly. Unthresholded IQ projections also show
large repeat variation. At 4.110 GHz, the +8-MHz short-reference contrast change
warns against interpreting the signal as relaxation alone. No TLS suppression,
frequency displacement, or upward-transition rate is established.

The next stage concentrates on these candidates and measures a zero-drive null:

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run --confirmation-check
```

At each of 4.098 and 4.110 GHz, collect ground/excited preparations and 2/10-us
holds. Randomize four tests: pump at 0, +8, or −20 MHz detuning, and a zero-gain
null at +8 MHz. **Every individual test** gets its own three-block sequence:
sham-before, test, sham-after. All three use the same programmed tone frequency,
flux, preparation, and hold. The null test and both surrounding shams all take
the existing `no_pump` path. `test_condition` identifies the candidate/null and
`comparison_id` identifies its triplet in both CSV and manifest.

Eight repeats of 400 shots produce 768 blocks: 192 driven, 576 zero-gain,
307,200 total probe shots. Gain 3000, 15-us pump duration, idle, reset and pulse
timing remain unchanged. This reduces the separation of each test from its
references and exposes false contrasts from drift/noise; it does not eliminate
rapid fluctuations or distinguish persistent carryover by itself. Outputs use
`q3/q3_pump_probe_confirmation_check_<UTC>_<id>/`. Evaluate each candidate against
its local references, the null distribution, repeat consistency, and the short
reference/IQ changes before deciding on a dose or delay scan.

## Confirmation results and amplitude dependence

Session `q3_pump_probe_confirmation_check_20260926T211749Z_abb5ca0f` completed
all 768 blocks (307,200 shots) at commit `c794ee5`, from 21:17:56 to 21:25:19
UTC. CSV counts/populations match the manifest and all blocks report 400 records.
The median before/after sham separation fell to 1.12 seconds (maximum 2.39),
but the median absolute sham change is still 0.0325 and the maximum is 0.2275.

Use each triplet's acquisition start times to interpolate its local sham, then
form one test-minus-sham contrast per repeat. Report repeat scatter, not merely
pooled binomial error. For comparison with the zero-drive null or detuned pump,
subtract the corresponding contrast within the same repeat, target, preparation,
and hold. Those triplets are nearby but not simultaneous. The intervals below
are unadjusted 95% Student-t intervals across eight repeat contrasts; they assume
independent repeats and do not account for the full set of inspected comparisons.

The clearest candidate is **4.110 GHz, +8 MHz pump, ground preparation, 2-us
hold**. Its local contrasts are +0.0688, +0.0601, +0.0428, +0.0405, +0.0803,
+0.0639, +0.0329, +0.0141: all eight positive, mean +0.0504. Relative to the
−20-MHz control's local contrasts, the difference is +0.0634 with interval
[+0.0404, +0.0864]. Relative to the noisier zero-drive null, it is +0.0326
with interval [−0.0232, +0.0885]. Thus it is a repeatable candidate relative to
its local references and detuned control, with uncertainty remaining in the
explicit null comparison. All 24 raw IQ files for these eight triplets reproduce
the saved classified counts. The unthresholded IQ-axis contrast has the same
positive mean sign.

The earlier 4.098-GHz ground/10-us +8-MHz candidate is +0.0348 relative to
its local shams, while its null is +0.0337. Their difference is +0.0011 with
interval [−0.0734, +0.0757]; it does not separate from this null check. At
4.110 GHz, +8 MHz no longer gives a consistent excited-prepared short-reference
decrease. There is no established relaxation improvement or TLS suppression.
The positive ground/short-hold signal may involve excitation, preparation/reset,
or another pump-dependent mechanism. Classified populations are not calibrated
thermal populations, and the intervening feedback-reset latency is not recorded.

The next stage tests amplitude dependence at fixed 15-us duration:

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run --dose-check
```

Probe only 4.110 GHz. For each ground/excited preparation and 2/10-us hold,
randomize five tests: +8 and −20 MHz each at programmed gains 1500 and 3000,
and the zero-gain null at +8 MHz. Every test retains its own matching-frequency
sham-before/test/sham-after triplet. Gain is saved per manifest point and the
effective waveform gain is recorded as `effective_pump_gain` in the CSV.
`test_condition` includes gain for nonzero tests, and `comparison_id` pairs the
three blocks. Gains are DAC settings, not a calibrated microwave power scale.

Twelve repeats of 400 shots yield 720 blocks (192 driven, 528 zero-gain),
288,000 recorded probe shots. All prior reset, flux, return, idle, and pulse
settings remain fixed, and no pump gain exceeds the already tested 3000.
Outputs use `q3/q3_pump_probe_dose_check_<UTC>_<id>/`. Look for repeatable
amplitude dependence at +8 MHz relative to both null and −20 MHz, and inspect
short-reference and hold-dependent changes before assigning a relaxation model.

## Amplitude results and added park-wait scan

Session `q3_pump_probe_dose_check_20260926T213400Z_b5d62447` completed all
720 blocks (288,000 shots) at commit `3811248`, from 21:34:10 to 21:40:56 UTC.
CSV counts/populations match the manifest; all blocks report 400 records.
Effective gain counts are 528 zero, 96 at 1500, and 96 at 3000. Median sham
separation is 1.14 seconds and median absolute before/after change is 0.035.
The same start-time interpolation and repeat-paired analysis as above was used.

At 4.110 GHz, ground preparation and 2-us hold:

| Test | Mean test minus local sham |
| --- | ---: |
| +8 MHz, gain 1500 | +0.0190 |
| +8 MHz, gain 3000 | +0.0510 |
| −20 MHz, gain 1500 | −0.0163 |
| −20 MHz, gain 3000 | −0.0182 |
| Zero-gain null | +0.0192 |

The +8-MHz gain-3000 contrast repeats the preceding run's +0.0504 average,
although only 10/12 local contrasts are positive in this run. Relative to the
same-gain −20-MHz control it is +0.0692, with unadjusted repeat-based 95% t
interval [+0.0271, +0.1112]. Relative to the null it is +0.0317 with interval
[−0.0148, +0.0782]. The gain-3000 minus gain-1500 contrast at +8 MHz is
+0.0320 with interval [−0.0143, +0.0783]. Thus the higher mean at larger gain
is suggestive but does not establish amplitude dependence. The corresponding
frequency-by-amplitude interaction also includes zero: +0.0339, interval
[−0.0223, +0.0900]. These intervals assume independent repeat contrasts and
are not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

All 36 raw IQ files for the +8-MHz gain-3000 ground/2-us triplets reproduce the
saved counts. Their mean unthresholded IQ-axis contrast is also positive.
Excited-prepared 10-us changes are similar for +8 and −20 MHz; there is still
no selective relaxation improvement established. Neither this experiment nor
the preceding ones establish TLS suppression or a calibrated excitation rate.

The next stage asks whether the pump-dependent contrast changes with an added
wait at park, using the existing backend's recovery interval:

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run --recovery-check
```

At 4.110 GHz, use +8 and −20 MHz at gain 3000, plus the zero-gain null.
Randomize ground/excited preparation, 2/10-us hold, and additional park waits
of 0, 100, or 500 us within each repeat. Each test retains its own matched
sham-before/test/sham-after triplet, including the same additional wait. Eight
repeats of 400 shots produce 864 blocks (192 driven, 672 zero), 345,600 shots.
The 15-us pump, native flux correction/return, reset settings and final 500-us
idle remain fixed. `additional_recovery_us` is saved per point and in the CSV;
the acquisition API receives it as `recovery_us`. Outputs use
`q3/q3_pump_probe_recovery_check_<UTC>_<id>/`.

The additional wait occurs **after the post-pump reset and its reference-time
guard, before probe preparation**. Zero remains a nonzero total pump-to-probe
latency because the return, readout and variable reset intervene. Longer waits
also permit qubit-state evolution at park and lengthen the shot period; no
extra reset follows this added interval. Accordingly this is a controlled
sequence-memory test, not a direct TLS lifetime measurement. Compare pump,
detuned and null contrasts separately at each wait and inspect both short
references and hold dependence before fitting any decay model.

## Recovery results and probe-hold scan

Session `q3_pump_probe_recovery_check_20260926T214935Z_f3398562` completed all
864 blocks (345,600 shots) at commit `935b77c`, from 21:49:48 to 22:00:50 UTC.
CSV counts/populations match the manifest and every block reports 400 records.
Median absolute before/after sham change is 0.0225, with median separation
1.42 seconds. The same local time interpolation and repeat-paired contrasts
were used; intervals below are unadjusted 95% t intervals across eight repeats.

Mean +8-MHz pump minus its local sham, ground preparation:

| Additional post-reset wait | 2-us probe hold | 10-us probe hold |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 us | +0.0412 | +0.0375 |
| 100 us | +0.0312 | +0.0036 |
| 500 us | −0.0013 | −0.0079 |

At 500 us both ground-probe contrasts are consistent with zero. For the 10-us
probe at zero added wait, the +8-minus-null contrast is +0.0383 with interval
[+0.0086, +0.0679], and +8-minus-20 is +0.0374 with interval [+0.0035, +0.0713].
The latter contrast changes by −0.0440 between 0 and 500 us, interval
[−0.0829, −0.0051]. This is evidence consistent with a transient pump-dependent
response, with multiplicity and the changing shot period still relevant.

The explicit null matters: ground/2-us at zero added wait has a positive null
contrast +0.0183 in all eight repeats (interval [+0.0107, +0.0259]). The
corresponding +8-minus-null result is only +0.0229, interval [+0.0003, +0.0455].
For that probe, the 500-minus-0-us change after null subtraction includes zero,
[−0.0472, +0.0134]. Local shams therefore do not remove every systematic or
history effect, and the ground/2-us curve alone does not establish a decay.

Ground-state reference populations also fall with added wait: the local shams
for +8-MHz ground/2-us change from about 0.135 at zero wait to 0.078 at 500 us.
These are classified signals, not calibrated thermal populations. The wait
changes preparation history as well as elapsed time, while the reset latency
remains unmeasured. No TLS lifetime is fitted, and no TLS suppression or
persistent frequency displacement is established. Excited-prepared probes do
not show a consistent selective survival improvement.

A raw-data check reclassified 120 blocks: all three zero-wait ground/2-us test
conditions and their references, plus the +8 ground/10-us triplets at 0 and
500 us. All counts match. The ground/2-us null offset remains in the final
350 shots as well as the first 50; it is not explained by simply discarding
the first 50 shots. Unthresholded IQ gives the same broad pattern of smaller
ground-probe response at 500 us.

Next, separate an early probe offset from changes with target hold time:

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run --probe-time-check
```

At 4.110 GHz, keep pump gain 3000 and duration 15 us, +8/−20-MHz controls,
and the zero-gain null. Randomize ground/excited preparation and programmed
probe holds 0.1, 2, 10, and 30 us, with no additional recovery wait. Every test
retains its own matching sham-before/test/sham-after triplet. Twelve repeats
of 400 shots produce 864 blocks (192 driven, 672 zero), 345,600 shots. Output
prefix is `q3/q3_pump_probe_probe_time_check_<UTC>_<id>/`.

The 0.1-us point still has a 0.5-us arrival and 40-us return; it is not zero
interaction time or a readout immediately after reset. The pinned native
correction generates finite positive-duration segments for all four requested
holds: target windows 0.6/2.5/10.5/30.5 us followed by the same 40-us complete
return. This was checked without hardware. No pulse backend changes are made.
An offset at the earliest point versus growth during the hold will guide a
subsequent location/reset control; neither outcome alone identifies a TLS.

## Probe-hold results and probe-location control

Session `q3_pump_probe_probe_time_check_20260926T220924Z_3cad5178` completed
864 blocks (345,600 shots) at commit `29ad774`, from 22:09:38 to 22:18:19 UTC.
CSV counts/populations match the manifest; all blocks report 400 records.
Median absolute before/after sham change is 0.03625, with median separation
1.18 seconds. Contrasts use the same local interpolation and repeat pairing.

| Programmed probe hold | +8-MHz ground-prepared test minus local sham | +8-MHz excited-prepared test minus local sham |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.1 us | +0.0490 | +0.0173 |
| 2 us | +0.0401 | +0.0165 |
| 10 us | +0.0142 | +0.0200 |
| 30 us | +0.0210 | +0.0334 |

The extra ground signal is already present at the earliest programmed hold.
That point still includes the 0.5-us arrival and 40-us return, so this does not
locate the effect before the entire probe excursion. At 0.1 us the local
contrast has an unadjusted repeat-based 95% t interval [+0.0115, +0.0865], but
subtracting the null gives +0.0451 with interval [−0.0253, +0.1154], and
subtracting the −20-MHz control gives +0.0292 with interval [−0.0137, +0.0721].
Null fluctuations include one +0.241 contrast; they materially limit inference.

None of the ground-prepared pump-control changes between 0.1 us and the later
holds excludes zero with these repeat-based intervals. Excited/10-us +8-minus-20
is +0.0310, interval [+0.0048, +0.0572], but its increase relative to 0.1 us
includes zero, [−0.0342, +0.0524]. Thus the data do not establish an extra
excitation rate during the hold or selective relaxation suppression. These
are unadjusted intervals over twelve repeats, not multiplicity-corrected claims.
A check of 72 raw blocks (ground/0.1-us +8 and null triplets) reproduced all
saved classified counts. Unthresholded IQ also has a positive early +8 offset.

Next, test whether the probe excursion to 4.110 GHz is required:

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run --location-check
```

Pump at the same 4.110-GHz flux target in every block, with +8/−20-MHz tones
at gain 3000 for 15 us, plus the zero-gain null. Randomize probe location
(`target` or `park`), ground/excited preparation, and 0.1/10-us hold. Twelve
repeats of 400 shots give 864 blocks (192 driven, 672 zero), 345,600 shots.
Every test has its own matched-location, matched-hold sham-before/test/sham-after
triplet. Additional recovery stays zero; reset and final idle settings are fixed.

The park probe remains at DAC −25146 (configured park frequency about 4.367 GHz)
while the target probe visits DAC −16151 (model frequency 4.110021 GHz). Both
use the same native compensated segment durations, generator pulse lengths,
and synchronization barriers. For park, every segment's displacement from park
is zero; compensation and stepping stay enabled to preserve timing. The pump's
configured target is restored after emitting the probe. Park mode rejects
unsupported non-native/ramp/overlapping-return settings rather than silently
using a differently timed path. Preparation pulses and readout remain at park.

The real flux-command emission path was checked with both synthetic and this
run's saved native correction: for 0.1/10-us holds, target/park instruction
sequences match apart from flux gain, and every park gain equals −25146.
This is software verification, not a measurement of physical flux settling.

Outputs use `q3/q3_pump_probe_location_check_<UTC>_<id>/`. `probe_location` and
`probe_dc_gain` identify the probe; the existing `target_frequency_ghz`,
`realized_frequency_ghz`, and `dc_gain` continue to identify the pump target.
Compare pump-control contrasts within each location, then their difference.
A response that also appears at park would implicate effects not requiring the
probe's loss-region excursion. A difference between locations would still not
by itself identify a microscopic TLS, because relaxation and flux histories
differ between the two locations.

## Location-stage calibration rejection and timing diagnostic

Session `q3_pump_probe_location_check_20260926T222531Z_cbda4df8` failed during
`prepare_reset_session` at commit `7414ec3`. All 864 measurement points remain
pending; no park/target probe comparison was acquired. The `pynq` import notice
was not the stopping error: the PC successfully connected to the remote QICK.

The three saved attempts under `q3_2026_09_26/q3_18_25_39_...` show:

| Attempt | Payload peak fit score | Loop peak fit score | Loop held-out ground acceptance |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0.7225 | 0.6755 | 0.0010 |
| 2 | 0.7345 | 0.6980 | 0.0000 |
| 3 | 0.7215 | 0.6795 | 0.0000 |

`qua_thresholds` searches for a training threshold with score greater than 0.7.
When none exists, its fallback selects the first positive-score threshold near
the minimum projection. That accepts essentially no ground shots. The separate
20% confident-assignment guard then correctly rejects the calibration. These
peak values are training fit scores, not measured reset fidelity. The prior
successful loop calibration at 18:09:34 had peak score 0.7010 and ground
acceptance 0.684: the fit was already close to the policy boundary. Payload IQ
centers/separation remain broadly comparable, and all arrays contain 2000 records.

All three failed attempts and the preceding success share config SHA256
`df81b794e6baecad99e998f6515891d773be1158f9b6f6033476e4c3e9877588`.
No changed calibration settings or executed location-probe code explain this
failure. The overlapping loop reference distributions fail the current fitting
criterion; why they became insufficiently separated is not yet established.

Code inspection found a pre-existing timing mismatch: production calibration
uses `build_calibration_config(tls.BaseConfig, ...)`, leaving the reference
program's default legacy accumulator timing and 2-us read delay. The pump-probe
runner applies `official_wait_all`, pre-measure synchronization, flush off, and
10-us read delay only after calibration. Calibration also deliberately uses
ramped per-shot park references, unlike persistent-park active acquisition.
These differences justify a diagnostic, but do not prove the cause of this
particular failure. Do not weaken thresholds or reuse a stale calibration.

Run the new calibration-only diagnostic:

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbeResetCheck --run
```

It acquires profiles in forward/reverse order:
legacy, official, official_guard20, official_guard20, official, legacy.
Each profile collects 2000 ground and 2000 pi-prepared records in each of
payload and loop contexts: 48,000 reference shots total. The legacy profile
preserves the current production calibration config. Official changes only the
four feedback timing fields used by the pump-probe runner. Official_guard20
additionally increases loop recovery from 10 to 20 us. Drive frequencies,
amplitudes, reference flux protocol and the 0.7/0.2 policy values stay fixed.

Every profile saves `config.json`, `calibration.json`, and `calibration_raw.npz`
in a distinct subfolder, including rejected fits. The manifest records the
baseline config hash, profile results, acceptance/rejection reason and commit.
Expected quality rejections do not stop this diagnostic; transport or unexpected
acquisition failures do. No active feedback loop, TLS pump, or location scan is
run, and no fitted calibration is installed automatically. Output prefix:
`q3/q3_pump_probe_reset_check_<UTC>_<id>/`.

Compare repeated profiles, raw distributions, and both contexts before choosing
a repair. Even improved scores under official timing would not alone establish
root cause or validate equivalence to the full active acquisition sequence.

## Reset timing diagnostic result and location retry

Session `q3_pump_probe_reset_check_20260926T223505Z_7adae581`, commit
`0b27e6d`, completed all six profiles between 22:35:05 and 22:35:28 UTC.
All 48,000 reference shots were saved. Offline refitting of both contexts in
every profile exactly reproduces the saved classifiers and manifest metrics;
all six bundles pass the unchanged 20% confident-assignment guard. Saved config
digests also reproduce exactly, including the unchanged legacy baseline hash.

| Profile, acquisition order | Payload peak fit score | Loop peak fit score | Loop held-out ground acceptance |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Legacy, first | 0.7375 | 0.7545 | 0.528 |
| Official, first | 0.7765 | 0.7470 | 0.549 |
| Official + 20-us recovery, first | 0.7625 | 0.7740 | 0.515 |
| Official + 20-us recovery, second | 0.7695 | 0.7925 | 0.505 |
| Official, second | 0.7545 | 0.7480 | 0.571 |
| Legacy, second | 0.7450 | 0.7570 | 0.556 |

The original calibration settings now pass at both ends of the comparison.
Official timing alone does not improve the loop peak score in these repeats.
The 20-us profiles have higher peak scores, but two adjacent repetitions do not
establish a robust improvement, explain the prior rejection, or measure active
reset fidelity. The earlier failure was not reproduced; its physical cause
remains unresolved. Do not describe this as a confirmed timing repair.

Next step: retry the existing location check without changing calibration or
acquisition settings. It acquires and validates a fresh production calibration;
none of the diagnostic fits is reused. This preserves comparability with prior
pump-probe stages and retains the existing rejection guard.

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run --location-check
```

The planned run remains 864 measurement blocks, comparing target and park
probes after identical target pumping. If fresh calibration fails again,
inspect that failure rather than weakening the acceptance policy or repeatedly
retrying until a marginal calibration passes.

## Completed location comparison

Session `q3_pump_probe_location_check_20260926T224556Z_2aba0564`, commit
`ed0ba6a`, completed all 864 blocks / 345,600 shots from 22:46:01 to
22:55:17 UTC. Payload and loop peak calibration fitting scores were 0.7110
and 0.7290; loop held-out ground acceptance was 0.559. These scores do not
measure reset fidelity. The payload classifier's held-out false-positive
fraction was 0.192, so classified excited fractions are not corrected physical
populations.

For each triplet, subtract a time-interpolated before/after sham. The following
are ground-prepared +8-MHz responses, in percentage points; intervals are
unadjusted 95% Student-t intervals across twelve repeats:

| Hold | Target response | Park response | Target minus park |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1 us | +0.97 [-3.22, +5.15] | +2.12 [-3.31, +7.56] | -1.16 [-8.12, +5.81] |
| 10 us | +3.01 [-0.67, +6.70] | +3.81 [-0.27, +7.89] | -0.80 [-7.60, +6.00] |

All location interactions after additionally subtracting the null or -20-MHz
control include zero, for both preparations and both holds. No target-specific
response or equivalence between locations is established. At park, the g/10-us
+8-minus-null contrast is +5.72 points [0.14, 11.30]; the g/0.1-us
+8-minus-minus20 contrast is +8.44 [2.45, 14.42]. These are exploratory,
unadjusted comparisons among multiple endpoints. The latter includes a negative
-20-MHz response, not a resolved positive +8-MHz response alone. Neither
establishes TLS excitation, cooling, or improved lifetime.

Median absolute before/after sham change is 3.375 points (maximum 24 points),
over a median 1.244-second triplet span. Repeat scatter substantially limits
precision. All 864 manifest/summary rows, shot counts, probe DAC labels and
effective pump gains agree. Raw IQ reclassification reproduces 144 blocks
(57,600 shots): g/10-us, both locations, +8 and null triplets. Discarding the
first 50 or 200 shots retains a similar park contrast but widens its interval
to include zero; this sensitivity check is not a replacement primary analysis.

Next: one independent repeat of the unchanged `--location-check` experiment,
with a new production calibration and the same quality guards. Retain this
first run regardless of the repeat outcome. Assess repeatability of the
predefined location contrasts and null controls across both sessions; do not
select whichever hold, control, or session happens to look significant. If
large fluctuations persist without a reproducible contrast, prioritize
readout/reset stability diagnostics over further pump-parameter scans.

## Independent location repeat and reference-stability next step

Session `q3_pump_probe_location_check_20260926T230016Z_fa6209b8`, commit
`e5ccf98`, completed 864 blocks / 345,600 shots from 23:00:21 to 23:09:52 UTC.
Payload/loop peak calibration fit scores were 0.7250/0.7245, and loop held-out
ground acceptance was 0.646. All manifest/summary counts and probe DAC/pump-gain
labels agree. Raw IQ independently reproduces the g/10-us +8/null triplets at
both locations (144 blocks / 57,600 shots).

The short-hold park +8/null triplets were also checked directly from raw IQ
in both sessions: 72 blocks / 28,800 shots per session. Reclassification exactly
reproduces their counts and the +4.79/+5.02-point null-corrected contrasts.

The planned repeat retains an interesting park response but does not establish
TLS-specific probe dynamics. Ground-prepared short-hold park contrasts were:

| Contrast, percentage points | First location run | Repeat |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| +8 MHz minus its local sham | +2.12 | +4.94 |
| Above contrast minus null contrast | +4.79 | +5.02 |
| Above contrast minus -20-MHz contrast | +8.44 | +4.31 |

Equal-session averages give short-hold park +8-minus-null +4.90 points
[+0.33, +9.47] and +8-minus-minus20 +6.37 [+2.88, +9.87]. These are exploratory,
unadjusted 95% intervals using within-session repeat variances and a
Welch-Satterthwaite degrees-of-freedom approximation. They are conditional on
these two sessions; two sessions do not provide a reliable estimate of
between-session reproducibility. The two runs use the same randomized schedule.

All target-minus-park interactions after null or -20-MHz subtraction still
include zero, for both preparations and holds. A few unadjusted contrasts with
local sham alone exclude zero (including excited-prepared location differences),
but these are not robust across the additional control corrections. The first
run's g/10-us park +8-minus-null contrast was +5.72 points; the repeat is -0.12.
Thus no clear target-specific effect or lifetime improvement is established,
and the earlier 10-us park endpoint did not reproduce. Do not interpret an
unresolved difference as proof that locations are equivalent.

Median absolute local sham change remains 3.5 points (maximum 26), over median
1.354-second triplets. Follow the prior decision to investigate reference
stability before further pump-parameter scans. Extend the existing calibration
diagnostic with `--stability-check`: twelve identical legacy profiles with
scheduled starts 30 seconds apart, each containing 2000 shots for ground/pi in
payload/loop contexts (96,000 total). Starts are monotonic deadlines and actual
acquisition start times are recorded separately from scheduling waits; late
slots are acquired without dropping data. The last scheduled start is at
330 seconds, so normal runtime is about six minutes.

Keep drive, readout, timing, reference flux protocol, and 0.7/0.2 policies fixed.
Save rejected fits and all raw references; install none. Offline analysis will
compare IQ centers/separation, original versus freshly fitted classifiers, and
quality metrics over time. This is an unpumped reference test with per-shot
park ramps and sequential ground/pi acquisitions, not a direct measurement of
active-reset fidelity or a full reproduction of the pump sequence. A stable
result would not rule out pump-induced or feedback-specific effects.

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbeResetCheck --run --stability-check
```

Output prefix: `q3/q3_pump_probe_reference_stability_<UTC>_<id>/`.
