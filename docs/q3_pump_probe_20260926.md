# q3 pump–probe notebook: 26 September 2026

Measurement-PC workflow: pull `tls-spectroscopy`, run the named Python module,
then inspect NAS results before selecting another experiment. No hardware is
accessed by `--plan`. Do not run another acquisition concurrently.

NAS root: `Z:/FluxTeam/Data/FTT02_AlOxJJ_2026_08_28/RFSOC`
(Mac mount: `/Volumes/ourphoton/FluxTeam/Data/FTT02_AlOxJJ_2026_08_28/RFSOC`).

## Baseline findings

The full-band localizer found strong loss near 4.098 GHz. The subsequent
eight-delay measurement put the feature nearer 4.106 GHz, but changed both the
delay protocol and program chunking. Those measurements alone did not establish
TLS motion.

The unchunked A–B–A comparison used a shared calibration, 2-us reference holds,
40-us returns, and A=[25,60,100] versus B=[4,8,25] us survival increments.
Session `q3/q3_pump_probe_protocol_check_20260926T200743Z_138f511c`
completed at commit `3d4fc6b`. In the common 25-us observable, B was displaced
by about +2.1 MHz relative to the average A curve; IQ centroids showed the same
effect. This implicated protocol dependence without identifying a mechanism.

The follow-up session
`q3/q3_pump_probe_history_check_20260926T201656Z_1ae78613` completed all eight
arms at commit `8852cad`:
A10, B10, A500, B500, B500, A500, B10, A10. The numbers are park idle in us
after readout and feedback reset. Each arm acquired 91 frequencies from
4.080–4.125 GHz and 500 shots per condition, with one shared calibration.

Descriptive translations of B against A, using the shared normalized 25-us
population and linear interpolation over 4092–4114 MHz:

| Comparison | 10-us idle | 500-us idle |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| First adjacent A/B pair | +2.360 MHz | −0.240 MHz |
| Final adjacent A/B pair | +1.714 MHz | +0.718 MHz |
| Repeat-averaged curves | +1.862 MHz | +0.242 MHz |
| Repeat-averaged IQ projections | +1.778 MHz | +0.249 MHz |

These are shape-alignment estimates, not independently calibrated TLS
frequencies or confidence intervals. A500 also drifted about −1.28 MHz between
its two scans. Median classified P0 was 0.276–0.338 at 10-us idle and
0.116–0.140 at 500-us idle; median P1−P0 improved from 0.316–0.356 to
0.414–0.456. These reference signals include assignment/preparation effects and
must not be interpreted directly as thermal populations.

The longer pause substantially reduces the protocol mismatch. It does not
distinguish flux memory, bath dynamics, reset effects, or other causes, and does
not remove all drift. The next experiment therefore sweeps a small region and
uses nearby-in-time controls instead of assuming one fixed TLS frequency.

## First direct-microwave pilot

```powershell
python -u -m WorkingProjects.TLS_Spectroscopy.Client_modules.Runners.TLSPumpProbePilot --run
```

Seven target frequencies: 4.094, 4.098, 4.100, 4.102, 4.104, 4.106, 4.110 GHz.
At each target, pump and probe use the same flux excursion. The microwave tone
is 15 us at gain 3000, with controls: zero-gain sham, nominal resonance from the
frozen flux model, and ±20 MHz detunings. Each condition has ground/excited
preparation and 2/10-us probe holds (an 8-us increment). The ground preparation
plays a zero-gain pi-length waveform to preserve timing.

There are three randomized repeats of 200 shots: 336 blocks, 67,200 recorded
probe shots. The four microwave controls for a given frequency/state/hold are
adjacent. Native reset runs before the pump and again after it. All conditions
retain the pinned native correction, 0.5-us arrival, 40-us complete pre-readout
return, and 500-us idle after the probe readout. Unlike the preceding scan,
the next pre-pump reset follows that idle. One calibration is shared.

Zero **additional** recovery does not mean zero pump-to-probe time: the
40-us return, readout, variable feedback reset, and probe preparation intervene.
After each reset, a 20-us reference-time guard from the final readout endpoint
includes the 10-us feedback wait and 10-us instruction headroom. This is needed
because QICK `wait_all` does not advance its pulse reference time
([QICK timing documentation](https://docs.qick.dev/latest/_autosummary/qick.asm_v1.html#qick.asm_v1.QickProgram.sync_all)).
The actual guard is recorded in per-block telemetry; total reset latency is not.
This pilot is not sensitive to every
possible short-lived TLS response and does not test persistent displacement.

Outputs are under `q3/q3_pump_probe_pilot_<UTC>_<id>/`: `manifest.json`,
`config.json`, `summary.csv`, and raw IQ `point_*.npz`. Completed blocks are
checkpointed and acquisition stops on error. Do not resume a partial session
by mixing a new calibration into it.

Evaluate excited survival together with ground-probe excitation, reference
contrast, both detuned controls, repeat consistency, and raw IQ changes. Any
effect remains a pump-dependent response until follow-up controls establish its
origin. A persistent-spectrum test needs a separate pump-once/observe protocol.
