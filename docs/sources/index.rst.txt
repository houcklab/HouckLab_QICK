The Quantum Desq
==================

Welcome to the Desq documentation, the home of the graphical
user interface for all quantum experiments using RFSoCs.

Supports MacOS and Windows.

******************

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _getting_started:

This section will guide you through setting up and using the Desq GUI for the first time, writing your own
experiments, and understanding the fundamental features of the interface.


Running the GUI for the First Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the Desq GUI for the first time, follow these steps:

    1. **Pulling from Git:**

       Ensure you have the latest version of Desq by cloning or pulling from the `Link HouckLab_QICK repository <https://github.com/houcklab/HouckLab_QICK>`_.
       Currently, the GUI resides on the ``Desq-development`` branch.

    2. **Configuring Environment:**

       Set up the required dependencies and environment variables for Desq. All required packages are given in the ``requirements.txt`` file found in the ``Desq_GUI`` folder.
       To use the file, ensure you are in the correct directory in command line and use the following commands as appropriate:

       ::

        # To update existing Desq_env conda environment
        conda activate your_env_name
        pip install -r requirements.txt

        # To create a Desq_env conda environment from scratch if one does not exist
        conda create --name your_env_name
        conda activate your_env_name
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    3. **Executing GUI**
       Launch the GUI after environment activation via ``python Desq.py`` on the command line and verify that it runs correctly.
