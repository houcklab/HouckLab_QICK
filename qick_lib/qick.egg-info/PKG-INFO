# QICK: Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit

The QICK is a kit of firmware and software to use the Xilinx RFSoC as to control quantum systems.

It consists of:
* Firmware for the ZCU111 RFSoC evaluation board.  
* The `qick` Python package
* [A quick start guide](quick_start) for setting up your board and running a Jupyter notebook example
* [Jupyter notebook examples](qick_demos) demonstrating usage

Note: The firmware and software here is still very much a work in progress. This is an alpha release. We strive to be consistent with the APIs but can not guarantee backwards compatibility.


Download and Installation
-------------------------

Follow the quick start guide located [here](quick_start) to set up your board, install `qick` on your board, and run a Jupyter notebook example.
